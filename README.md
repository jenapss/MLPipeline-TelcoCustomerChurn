# Machine Learning DevOps - ML Pipeline - Telco Customer Churn Prediction


```This repo if for Machine Learning DevOps project based on Telco Customer Churn Prediction```

This pipeline consists of following stages:
1) Getting data from the data source
2) Data Cleaning
3) Train, val, test set data split
4) Model training


Current Stage: 
Built Reproducible Model Workflow

Metrics:

Trained on Random Forest Model available on scikit-learn package.
Achieved accuracy random forest model is 79% and this is not what maximum can be done with this dataset and random forest model.



TODO list:
1) Build Reproducible Model Workflow DONE âœ…
2) Deploy a Scalable ML Pipeline in Production
3) ML Model Scoring and Monitoring
